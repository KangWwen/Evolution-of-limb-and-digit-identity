Natural selection has sculpted tetrapod limbs, particularly the digits, into a tremendous morphological diversity, but the underlying developmental mechanism remains unclear. 
This leads to an enduring debate concerning the identity of the three digits of bird wing. 
Here we employ comparative transcriptomics of the digits from 6 species to identify gene expression signatures associated with the evolution of digit number and morphology.

The codes are used to create the plots in _Evolution of limb and digit identity genes since the jawed vertebrate ancestor_
